# Short-term

- [ ] Reuse entity identifier, allows to replace `@sparse` hash with array
- [ ] better API for multiple components - iterating, array
- [ ] correctly delete multiple components (linked list)
- [ ] check that all singleframe components are deleted somewhere
- [ ] benchmark comparison with flecs
- [ ] 

# Future

- [ ] Callbacks on adding\deleting components
- [ ] Work with arena allocator
